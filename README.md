# qi4_demo
Demo program for the QI4 libray

QI4 is a library that aims to facilitate the development cycle of
numerical simulations of Quantum Information related problems.
It includes fortran subroutines and functions for quantum operators,
states, measures, Hamiltonians, master equations, master-equation solvers
and others.

As a secondary goal, this library aims to be quick. Many functions and methods
will be revisited and optimized in following versions of the library.
